# UROSCANSEQ Explorer TODOs

## Heatmap

* [X] Update colours for the heatmap to the familiar palette.
* [X] Add an option for users to select predefined gene lists for the heatmap, such as Immune, stromal, and macrophages.
* [X] Remove sample IDs in the heatmap.
* [X] Add an annotation track for a selected metadata variable.
* [X] Add an option for sorting by proliferation, and include a button in the heatmap

## General UI

* [X] Add an option for generating proportion plots, and make it the default.
* [ ] Consider offering users the option to upload their data. How can it be done?
* [ ] Information regarding expression data, such as batch and log transformation.
* [X] Kaplan-Meier curve from meta-gene.

## Data

* [ ] Column and row centred for the incoming expression data.

## Meta-genes

* [X] Meta-gene, a summarized expression for a defined set of genes.
* [X] Interactive selection of genes to construct metagenes.
* [X] Select one gene or metagene and construct a Kaplan-Meier plot that is subtype-dependent. Add tick boxes for subtype selection.

## Metadata

* [X] Sanity check the other columns as well.
* [X] Examine the age column to determine why the numbers have been updated.
* [X] Ensure factor levels are in the correct order, e.g. EAU risk categories, stage, grade, etc.
* [X] Review all metadata columns and update variable names to make them more intuitive and descriptive.
* [ ] NMIBC vs. MIBC option in the metadata.
* [ ] Progression - Ta to T1 as another.
